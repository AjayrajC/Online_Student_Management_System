# Online_Student_Management_System
Student Management System is a robust application developed by integrating Python with MongoDB, that allows anybody to store data on an online MongoDB server. Using this you can add, delete, update, and display student information.

To use the application with your MongoDB server, replace the uri variable with your own MongoDB connection string.

Key features of the Student Management System include:

Adding Students: Users can add new student records by providing details such as registration number, name, email, class, and optional mobile number. The system ensures that all compulsory fields are filled before adding the record.
Deleting Students: Existing student records can be deleted by entering the registration number of the student to be deleted. The system checks for the existence of the student before proceeding with the deletion.
Updating Student Information: Users can update student information such as name, email, class, and mobile number. The system verifies the existence of the student before making any updates.
Displaying Student Details: The system provides a user-friendly interface to display all student records stored in the MongoDB database. The details include registration number, name, email, class, and optional mobile number.
To enhance the functionality of the Student Management System, additional features such as search, sorting, filtering, and authentication can be implemented. Additionally, improvements to the user interface, error handling, and data validation can further enhance the user experience. Moreover, integration with other services such as email notifications or SMS alerts can provide additional functionalities for administrators managing student records.
